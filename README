These are my Arch Linux PKGBUILD files for a proper 
MinGW-w64 cross-compilation environment.

Find them in the AUR for more details that are missing.

This general build order for a mingw-w64 cross-compiler
 is necessary:

1. headers binutils
2. gcc-base
3. crt winpthreads
4. gcc

One PKGBUILD will now take care of everything:
Sources (preferably Arch official versions for continuity):
 - gcc
 - binutils
 - mingw-w64 (headers+crt) latest stable versions
 - winpthreads (currently svn only :()

Things that require small/large hacks:
1. oneline sed command to prevent libiberty.a installation
2. split gcc package in gcc, (gcc-c++,?) gcc-fortran, gcc-ada, 
                        gcc-java, gcc-objc, gcc-obj-c++

The resulting binary packages:
1. mingw-w64 (contains headers, crt, and winpthreads due to
              header collision issue)
2. mingw-w64-binutils: because it can be split off
3. mingw-w64-gcc-*:

All in group 'mingw-w64' or 'mingw-w64-toolchain'.
